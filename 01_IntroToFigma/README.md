# What is Figma

## Generic UX Design Workflow

It all depends on the scope and size of th project on timeline.

* **(1) Concepting, brainstorm, gather info** - looking at user-base, and the size, the scope of the project determines how much time will be spent on it
* **(2) Wireframe/Design** - some are skipping wireframe these days and going straight to design phase
* **(3) Prototype** - taking the wireframe/design and adding the action to let users try it out
* **(4) Share/test/feedback** - to gather feedback
* **(5) Iterate** - we iterate all over again, like do another design phase, another prototype change, share it, test, feedback
* **(6) Bulid**
