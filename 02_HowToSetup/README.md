## Creating a Project

When beginning design project in Figma, you can start by either creating a project or a file.

In this example, we're gonna start with making a project, web app design. Look at the difference between files and projects and how to use them together. Projects is essentially made up of associated files.

You can also import from project from Sketch, but you'll need to go into Account Setting to download a font package.

There's also the Team setup, which you just click on the New Team icon at bottom left and invite people to join the team.
