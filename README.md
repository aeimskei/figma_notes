# Figma - UX Design Tool (new tool)

## Intro

## Setting up a Figma Project

* **What is Figma?** - how it fits in design workflow
* **Frames** - they're like artboard in Sketch
* **Vector** - like shapes
* **Text** - formatting it
* **Images and masks**
* **Layers**
* **Components & contraints** - similar to symbols in other design tool applications
* **Versioning** - how it helps

## Collaborating, Sharing and Exporting

* **Device Preview** - how to preview directly on your device (for Mac)
* **Sharing** - how to share the files and working in tandem with somebody, you can have multiple people editing the same file live (cool!)
* **Commenting**
* **Exporting** - and what it means

## Prototyping

But this requires Framer to get that done.
